Practical-Ruby-Projects
=======================
- Change maker is change.rb. prices.txt contains random prices in cents. The project comes from the book Practical Ruby Projects.
  - Not only do the change given to the customers will be from an optimized Greedy algorithm (start with the largest coin first and yet gives the least amount of coin at the same time; ex. if there are 70 cent coins available, to give the change of $1.40, the change given won't be say, one 1 dollar coin, 1 quater, 1 dime, 1 nickle; it would be 2 70 cents coins, as it contains the least number of coins.), the customers will also pay with the most amount of loose change to lighten their wallets.
